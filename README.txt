************************************Getting Started************************************

After everyone has submitted their response, download it into CSV format. This file 
should be named "Event_Feedback.csv." If it is not, you'll have to go into the code and
fix line (INSERT NUMBER HERE) because we hard-coded it. Make sure that the python script
and the csv are in the same directory, and then execute the code using the following 
command: ./python MediaGroupMaker.py > MediaAnalysisGroups.txt. This should run through
the file, make the groups, and then dump them into a text file.
